## Purpose
This program creates an address book of people and their contact information that can be sorted 3 ways (inorder, preorder, postorder). Users can add, delete, and modify a record provided they know the ID number. The number of records (nodes) can be counted.
This lab is adapted from Lab 4, Binary Search Tree https://github.com/lizeyliz/Lab-4-BST-.git
We have adapted this program to be an AVL tree (balanced).

## Extra Credit
Coded lab in C++ as well as Java.
